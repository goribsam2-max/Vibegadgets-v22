            Once an order has been successfully placed and delivered, we do not
            accept returns. We firmly do not offer money-back guarantees or
            refunds under any circumstances. Please verify the product model,
            specifications, and compatibility before confirming your purchase.
            This policy ensures all our customers receive 100% brand-new
            untouched inventory.

          </h2>
          <p>
            General products do not come with a warranty. Warranty is strictly
            limited only to specific products where it is explicitly written and
            stated on the product page. If a product does not mention a warranty
            period, it is sold "as is" without any warranty coverage.
