            Authentication & Login Security
          </h2>
          <p>
            We offer secure authentication via Google Login and Manual
            Registration.

            <strong>Google Login:</strong> This is a globally recognized, highly
            secure authentication method. By logging in with Google, we only
            receive your basic profile information (Name, Email, and Avatar)
            required to set up your account. We never have access to your Google
            password or any other sensitive data. It ensures a fast, risk-free
            experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Manual Login:</strong> If you prefer manual login, your
            credentials are encrypted using industry-leading hashing algorithms
            before being stored. Your password is completely secure and
            unreadable by anyone, including our own staff.
